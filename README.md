## Introduction

### What is WinUI?

[WinUI](https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/) is a user interface layer that contains modern controls and styles for building Windows apps. As the native UI layer in Windows it embodies Fluent Design, giving each Windows app the polished feel that customers expect.

As of version 3.0 it has been decoupled from the underlying Windows development platforms such as WinForms, WPF and UWP.
